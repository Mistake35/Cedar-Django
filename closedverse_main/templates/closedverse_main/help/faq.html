        <p>Hey there! If you have any questions about {{ brand_name }}, this page aims to answer them.</p>
		<h2>What is {{ brand_name }}?</h2>
			<p>{{ brand_name }} is a website based on <a href="https://github.com/Mistake35/Cedar-Django">Cedar-Django,</a> which is a Miiverse clone written in Python utilising the Django framework. In simpler terms, the owner of {{ brand_name }} uses Cedar-Django to power this website.</p>
		<h2>What is Closedverse?</h2>
			<p>Closedverse was a social network project that was developed by PF2M and Arian Kordi. It was inspired by Miiverse, a social networking service that was offered by Nintendo for its gaming consoles. Closedverse was originally intended to be a safe and friendly community for users to connect and share, but it unfortunately had to shut down on April 4, 2019.<br>Cedar-Django is based off of Closedverse, hence their many, many similarities and why Closedverse is linked on the homepage.</p>
		<h2>The legacy of Miiverse clones</h2>
			<p>Miiverse clones, such as Closedverse, have a complicated history. Many of these projects have faced challenges and faced criticism for their moderation and management. Closedverse, for example, was known for its drama and conflict, which ultimately led to its shut down.</p>
			<p>Despite these challenges, {{ brand_name }} aims to provide a safe and friendly space for users to connect and share. We are committed to maintaining a positive and respectful community, and we have put in place measures to ensure that our moderation is effective and fair. If you have any concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to contact us.</p>
		<h2>What data do we collect?</h2>

			<p>In addition, any data that users choose to include in their profiles is stored in our database. Users can remove this data at any time, unless they are banned from the site.</p>
